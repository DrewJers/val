    It's a lil gay, but idgaf — it's physically impossible for me to hear this song without thinking about you.<br><br>

    I honestly couldn't even tell you where I first heard it, but there are a couple of standout lines to me.<br><br>

    <span class="lyric">"You can act all shy but you know that I want you"</span> makes me think back to how shy/guarded you were when we were first going out. I was really nervous the first couple times we hung out lol, but I always loved being affectionate and seeing you try to stay nonchalant while I was loving up on you.<br><br>

    <span class="lyric">"So terrified of the road that takes you… me too"</span> — I know how anxious or nervous you can be thinking about the future, and in a lot of ways, I feel the same way. I'll always be there to comfort you and support you. The one thing I <em>am</em> certain of is us. You're a part of every path I have moving forward, Gab.<br><br>

    <span class="lyric">"Everyone adores you, at least I do"</span> and 
    <span class="lyric">"Everybody thinks of you when they sleep at night — when I say everybody I'm actually referring to me"</span> —
    I think so many people *do* adore you. There's so much to love, and I've said this before, but you have such a magnetic presence. I know sometimes you have doubts about being lovable, but I promise Gabby, loving you comes so easy and there's no part of you that I don't adore.<br><br>

    And even though the next line is kinda fucking stupid lmfao, I really do always think of you when I'm asleep at night. When I'm not with you, my bed feels so much bigger and emptier. You're the last person I want to talk to, and you're my favorite way to end my day.
