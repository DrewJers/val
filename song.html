    It's a lil gay, but idgaf it's physically impossible for me to hear this song without thinking about you<br>
    I honestly couldn't even tell you where I first heard it, but there are a couple of standout lines to me. <br>
    "You can act all shy But you know that I want you" makes me think back to how shy/guarded you were when we were first going out. I was really nervous the first couple times we hung out lol but I always loved being affectionate and seeing you try to stay nonchalant while I was loving up on you. <br>
    "So terrified of the road that takes you... Me too" I know how anxious or nervous you can be thinking about the future, and in a lot of ways, I feel the same way. I'll always be there to comfort you and support you. The one thing I *am* certain of is us. You're a part of every path I have moving forward Gab. <br>
    "Everyone adores you At least I do" and "Everybody thinks of you when they sleep at night When I say everybody I'm actually referring to me" I think so many people *do* adore you, there's so much to love, and I've said this before, I think you have such a magnetic presence. I know sometimes you have doubts about being lovable, but I promise Gabby, loving you comes so easy and there's no part of you that I don't adore. And even tho the next line is kinda fucking stupid lmfao, I do always think of you when I'm asleep at night. When I'm not with you, my bed feels so much bigger and emptier. You're the last person I want to talk to, and you're my favorite way to end my day.
