  <h1>An extra letter for my love</h1>
  <p>
    I really hope you've enjoyed everything so far. I know it can be difficult to surprise you from so far away, but I wanted to try my best. I just really wanted to put into words how much I love and cherish you, baby. I'm so blessed and lucky to have you in my life. I think you deserve the world, and I'll spend the rest of my life trying to give that to you.
    <br><br>
    You're such a sweet and sincere person, and I want to give you all the love and time I have for as long as you let me. I got you a bunch of things this go around :) The second I saw the Buccees plush I knew I had to get him for you LOL and now you got one to match my lil fat chud one.
    <br><br>
    Then, I got you Guatemalan Jade. It symbolizes eternity, harmony, and a deep connection with nature and spirits. I think it serves as a sweet symbol of our relationship. Our love is eternal, and there's no one else I feel as connected to as you. You're my other half baby and our relationship is built on that harmony. Finally, I know you've got some witchery going on... but seriously, I deadass am convinced you and your family have strong spiritual ties. I hope you like the jade, it's as captivating as you are Gab.
    <br><br>
    And lastly, of course, I couldn't forget your m&m minis :) I love you so much and I'll never get tired of saying it. I promise this weekend will be so great, I want to show you a great time baby--you deserve nothing less.
  </p>
